**1. Data Acquisition:**

* **Description:** Securing student data from Chandigarh University itself or approved sources. 
* **Important Considerations:**
    * **Data Source Reliability:** Verifying the data source is credible and reflects the student population you're analyzing.
    * **Data Privacy Compliance:** Adhering to data privacy regulations when handling student information. Anonymize data if necessary.
    * **Compatible File Format:** Ensuring the data is in a format compatible with Excel (e.g., CSV, XLSX).

**2. Data Cleaning and Preparation:**

* **Description:** Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. This may involve removing duplicates, correcting errors, formatting data types (numbers, dates), and handling missing values.
* **Specific Actions:**
    * **Remove Duplicates:** Identifying and eliminate any duplicate student entries.
    * **Correct Errors:** Fixing typos, inconsistencies, or formatting errors within the data.
    * **Format Data Types:** Ensuring data is formatted correctly (e.g., subject scores as numbers).
    * **Handle Missing Values:** Deciding how to address missing data points (e.g., remove rows, impute values based on averages).

**3. Data Exploration and Visualization:**

* **Description:** Exploring the data to identify trends and patterns. Utilizing various charts and graphs (histograms, bar charts, scatter plots) to effectively visualize the data.
* **Specific Visualization Examples:**
    * **Histograms:** Visualizing the distribution of continuous variables like exam scores.
    * **Bar Charts:** Comparing categorical variables like student enrollment across different programs.
    * **Scatter Plots:** Exploring relationships between variables, such as study hours and exam performance.
    * **PivotTables and Charts:** Creating pivot tables to summarize and analyze data by categories (gender).
